Classes

### Session

The Session class is responsible for managing the details of a session, including:

*   **Attributes:**
    
    *   sessionId: The unique ID of the session.
        
    *   location: The location of the session.
        
    *   talkList: An array of talks scheduled for the session (up to 4 talks).
        
    *   currentSize: The current number of talks in the session.
        
*   **Methods:**
    
    *   scheduleTalk(Talk talk): Adds a talk to the session if there is space and if it isnâ€™t already scheduled.
        
    *   cancelTalk(Talk talk): Removes a scheduled talk from the session.
        
    *   getSessionId(), getLocation(), and other getters/setters.
        
    *   Overrides toString() to provide a string representation of the session.
        

### Talk

The Talk class represents an individual talk and implements Comparable for sorting based on start time.

*   **Attributes:**
    
    *   talkId: Unique identifier for the talk.
        
    *   speaker: Name of the speaker.
        
    *   title: Title of the talk.
        
    *   startTime: Start time of the talk as a LocalDateTime object.
        
*   **Methods:**
    
    *   Getters and setters for all attributes.
        
    *   Overrides compareTo(Talk otherTalk) to sort talks by start time.
        
    *   Overrides toString() to provide a string representation of the talk.
